I am going to take a different approach to completing this week's material:

Instead of first watching all of the videos in sequences, I will first attempt one of the four problems.

After completing that, I will then either decide to complete more or return to the videos, now having
a tangible idea of what it is I want to learn.

Hopefully this avoids wasting time on trying to grasp for things that don't pertain to practical programming.

Oh, and also, I think it should become practice for me to time my programming - a Start and End time commented in the code
would suffice.

Actually, I think a better idea would be to start a serious schedule. Too much of your learning is hingeing on the whims
of the current moment. The reason you learned Linear Algebra so well is because your body and mind had a set rhythm that 
it adapted to.

What if my end goal was just to get down every single exercise, problem set? That way I wouldn't falsely prioritize
the passive consumption of video lectures, but could still have the freedom to watch them when I genuinely wanted to 
search for a concept...
