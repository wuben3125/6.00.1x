# I am going to attempt to complete this entire unit (at least the lecture parts) before breakfast

# I first glimpsed the problem set so I know what it is I'm going to be doing
    # I then returned to the lectures to survey what it is that will help me accomplish this task best
        # It wasn't strictly in this order though - I did a couple of back and forths, because why not?
    # I then cranked out a semi-useful Planning document
    # I then opened a couple of files from before so I remember what kind of formats I want to stick to 
        (ex: executing functions whose exercises I answer incorrectly)
        
    # (this is low-key an exercise in my ability to type coherently) 
    
# I will improvise a system of breaks to maximize my efficiency and avoid getting stuck in any ruts:
    # At 9:00, I shall rest my eyeballs and brain
    # At 9:30 I shall attempt to do the same (and see whether this interval is too short)
    # At 10:__ I shall take another break

# You're spending too much time pretending to re-learn things you already have seen before/know, isntead of actively searching
    # for new content
    
# also, the number of mistakes and backtraces you're doing is indicative of tsomething, I feel
